            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Rafting Travel was founded in 2012 with a simple idea: to share the thrill of whitewater rafting with adventurers from all walks of life. What began as a small team of passionate river guides with a single raft quickly grew into a trusted company known for its commitment to safety, exploration, and unforgettable experiences. Over the years, we’ve expanded our routes, welcomed thousands of guests, and built a reputation for turning every trip into a story worth telling. Today, Rafting Travel continues to carry forward that original spirit of adventure, guiding people through roaring rapids and serene waterways alike.</p>
