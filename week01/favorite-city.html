    <h1>Medellin</h1>
    <p>Medellín is my favorite city because it perfectly blends innovation, beauty, and culture. Nestled in a valley and
        surrounded by green mountains, it’s often called the “City of Eternal Spring” for its pleasant weather
        year-round. I
        love how the city is alive with creativity, from its vibrant art and music scene to its modern metro system and
        cable
        cars that connect the hillsides. The people of Medellín are welcoming and full of resilience, which makes the
        city feel
        inspiring and full of hope. Every visit reminds me why it’s a place I truly admire and enjoy.</p>
