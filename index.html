            I’m 28 years old, originally from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, but I currently live in Figueira da Foz,
            Portugal. I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my wife. In March 2025, I enrolled in BYU
            Pathway Connect and
            graduated in August of the same year with an A grade in every course. On September 1, 2025, I officially
            began my degree at
            BYU–Idaho. I am passionate about learning new things and building programs, and I look forward to growing
            both
            personally and professionally as I continue my education.

        <img src="images/porto-city.jpg" alt="City of Porto">
        <p>Portugal is a country located in southwestern Europe on the Iberian Peninsula, bordered by Spain and the
            Atlantic Ocean.
            Known for its rich history of exploration, charming cities, and stunning coastlines, Portugal blends
            tradition with
            modern culture. Its capital, Lisbon, is famous for its colorful neighborhoods, fado music, and historic
            landmarks, while
            Porto is celebrated for its port wine and riverside views. With beautiful beaches in the Algarve, UNESCO
            World Heritage
            sites, and delicious cuisine, Portugal is a vibrant destination that offers both cultural depth and natural
            beauty.</p>
