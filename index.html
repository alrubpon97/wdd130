            I’m 28 years old, originally from San Pedro Sula, Honduras, but I currently live in Figueira da Foz,
            Portugal. I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my wife. In March 2025, I enrolled in BYU
            Pathway Connect and
            graduated in August of the same year with an A grade in every course. On September 1, 2025, I officially
            began my degree at
            BYU–Idaho. I am passionate about learning new things and building programs, and I look forward to growing
            both
            personally and professionally as I continue my education.
